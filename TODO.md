General
-------

* Need to cut down jqueryui to subset which we use to save transfer
  space (200k minimized is way too much).
* Consider compressing js/nagios-status.js

UI Features
-----------

* Integrate batch actions in the same way we're currently implementing
  line-level actions.
* Host-level actions (ack-ing a host, etc)
* Find a way of representing info and other urls for NOC use.

Nagios API Related

* Support for scheduled downtime.
* Batch queries for acking, etc?
